# Chimerik Lang

Chimerik gets its name from the mythical creature chimera. Originally a 
linguistic conlang (constructed language). This project is an attempt at 
repurposing it's lexicon for a programming language. This is intended 
entirely as a toy language.

The current state is just a tweaked version of [this tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/building-a-toy-programming-language-in-python) until 
I can make worth while changes.

## Why use this language?

Don't. It's a toy language, but I guess that doesn't stop people. So if you 
do use it, here are some of it's neat features.

 - Trileans: Feel limited with booleans? Don't want to bask in the glory of 
 Rust's godsend enum system? Triisida are 3 state enums.

 - Type compare: Using ```~=``` you can compare that variables are of the 
 same type.

## Progress

This project is still very early in development. The goal is to have a 
serviceable amount of syntax and grammar.
